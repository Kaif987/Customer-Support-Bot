# Customer Support Bot ðŸ¤–

This repository hosts a [Customer Support Bot](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/customer-support/customer-support/) built using **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, and **LangGraph**. The bot can answer queries regarding Flight booking, Hotel Booking, Excursion and Car rental services. It also has access to tools to lookup policies, make sensitive changes like book a car, or a hotel. This repository is built on top of [Agent Service Toolkit](https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit) which provides a great starting point for building this agent.

## Features

- **Streaming Support**: The response from agent can be streamed as token chunks or messages as per user preference
- **ToolCalling Support**: The agent can call tools to answer customer queries.
- **Human in the Loop Architechture**: The customer support bot asks for the users permission before calling a sensitive tool like booking a hotel for the user.
- **Asynchronous Design**: Utilizes async/await for efficient handling of concurrent requests.
